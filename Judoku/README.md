# Judoku

Judoku is the well known board game named "Sudoku", I developed it in Java using AWT

# Functionalities
1. Play an already saved Sudoku game
2. Edit a new game
3. Save a game


# How to compile
Enter the src directory and compile the source code using the following command:

`javac Judoku.java` 

nothing more

# How to run
From the source directory issue the following command:

`java -classpath . Judoku` 

# Note

As soon as you run the Judo application you will see an empty board. You have two choiches:

1. Open an existing game (in the root directory there is one prepared game named "1.txt") File-->Open


2. Edit a new game, clicking on an empty cell you will be able to insert a number, then you can save your new game.
