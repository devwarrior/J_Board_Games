# JavaBoardGames
JavaBoardGames is a collection of board games I developed some years ago using Java.

1. Judoku is the well known board game named "Sudoku", I developed it in Java using AWT.
2. JavaFifteen, the 15-puzzle is one of the most known sliding puzzles. This version has been implemented in Java using AWT.
3. JSweeper is the well known board game also known as "mine sweeper"
