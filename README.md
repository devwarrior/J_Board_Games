# JavaBoardGames
JavaBoardGames is a collection of board games I developed some years ago using Java.

    - Judoku is the well known board game named "Sudoku", I developed it in Java using AWT
    - JavaFifteen, the 15-puzzle is one of the most known sliding puzzles. This version has been implemented in Java using AWT.
